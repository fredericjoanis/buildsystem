The goal of these guidelines is to have a system where we follow convention over configurations.

no uppercase in file names
platform specific files add _platformspecifc at the end of the file (example_win32.cpp) --> if there's a example.cpp, the file will be excluded from build.

Folder structure
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
build is all build-related files
data is all data files
doc is all documentation
extern is all external projects that we include for linking
output is where our built binaries are found
projects is where sln files are located + .bat to launch generated projects
src is where all source code is located
tmp is where all intermediate files are located & generated projects located
tools is where all .exe used for the project are located
